# Like-Minded

There are times in our lives when we must enjoy experiences by ourselves. This could be due
to time constraints between you and your loved ones, 
or simply their lack of interest in the activity you are interested in. 
Like-Minded was comprised from the notion that experiences are best enjoyed with others. Within this app, users are able 
to create experiences that other users with similar interests can take part in. 

Experiences are represented as pins within a map. Once a user signs into Like-Minded, a map of experiences created by other users
will be generated. The initial map location and experiences users will see is dependent on their location, if they choose to allow
the app access.

 By clicking on these pins on the map, users will be given details of the experience, as well as the option to join. If users are not 
interested in the experiences they see on the map, they can create their own experience or move the map to a different location.

This application at its current state is a full stack application. For the frontend I am using React and Semantic UI. For the backend I am using Node, and PostgreSQL. 
Finally, I am using Google Maps and Google Places API for geolocation, place search and pins. 

Like-Minded is still in its beginning phase in its development. I have several phases planned out for this app that includes the creation
of channels where users participating in the same experiences can talk to eachother, as well as add each other as friends on this app. Along with this, I plan to 
either venture off into using Redux or React Native, as well as turn this app into a progressive web application.
